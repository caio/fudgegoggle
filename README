FUGDE GOGGLE AUTHENTICATOR

   Fudge Goggle is a simple offline web app that uses your
   webcam to read qr codes generated by the "export" function
   from that fudging thing and dumps a decoded list of
   otpauth:// URIs to be imported into software that respects
   their users.

Usage

   Build with: wasm-pack build --target web

   Serve with: python -mhttp.server

   Or serve however you prefer. index.html and the pkg/ dir are
   what you need exposed.

   Upon hitting the app it will ask permission to open your
   webcam, then it will periodically (every 1s) try to decode
   what it sees. Once it succeeds the video stream is closed
   and the decoded data is dumped on your face.

Known Issues

   This reads data from a canvas, your browser privacy settings
   may block it (check the developer console).

Why

   The time to put down my almost-a-decade-old phone is coming so
   I've started ensuring things are backed up.

   Whislt recovery codes exist, I have a TON of 2-factor-auth keys
   registered and I made the mistake of using that fugding goggle
   garbage, so now I can only export things via MULTIPLE limited,
   poorly described qr-codes.

   Suffice to say I didn't like finding out about this "feature",
   so here I am, rage coding to scratch an itch and maximizing
   frustration by trying to use a bunch of things that are very
   unfamiliar to me.

Future

   No. I'll return to this once (if?) I get a new phone and start
   setting up, but this is pretty much feature complete.
